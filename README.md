From the project structure, I have built a full-stack car rental app with a React/Vite client and a Node/Express server. The client includes pages for browsing cars, car details, bookings, login, and an owner dashboard with add/manage cars and bookings, plus shared UI components (navbar, hero, testimonials, newsletter, loader). The server exposes user/owner/booking routes with controllers, auth middleware, database config, and models for users, cars, and bookings, plus image upload handling.
